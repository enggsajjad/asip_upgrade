What is DLXsim?
===============

DLXsim is an simulator for a RISC-Processor designed by Larry B. Hostetler
and Brian Mirtich. It is an interactive program that loads DLX assembly
programs and simulates the operation of a DLX computer on those programs.
There is no real DLX based computer.

So why DLXsim?
==============

I needed a DLX simulator for my studies. There only was a simulator running
on the sparc stations, so I took the source and compiled it with gcc. I put
the executeable on Aminet, for anybody, who needs it. The sorce is not
included in this archive, because it is about 1.8MByte. If someone is
interested in the source, feel free to send me a mail. There is also a
WindowsTM version of the simulator, but it seems to be not fully bug-free.
(I have no PC to try myself ;-)

How to install DLXsim?
======================

All you have to do is to put the executeable file into a location where
it can be found by the shell. You also need the ixemul.library. I included
version 40.4 for various processors, see ixemul.library.lha. The
documentation is in TeX-format only, sorry for all of you, who don't have
it, but I don't bother writing plain ASCII documents at the moment.


I am interested, if anyone besides me has an interest in using DLXsim. So
I ask you to send me a mesage, if you really use DLXsim.
